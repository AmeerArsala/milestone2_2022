# Milestone2 2022

Hi and welcome to Milestone 2!

This milestone will focus on applying some of the skills we learned during our JavaScript bootcamp session on JavaScript objects. Hopefully, this will help to practice this skillset for future Milestones!

To start, click the "Console" button at the bottom of the screen and drag it up to cover the bottom view. We'll be using console.log() to complete this milestone so you can see the output of your code in the console window!

I will provide stubs for most of the functions you need to write as well as a console.log() statement for testing. MAKE SURE TO UNCOMMENT THESE FOR EACH PROBLEM YOU ARE WORKING ON!

As always, feel free to message any of the engineering leads if you have any questions or get stuck. Good Luck!
